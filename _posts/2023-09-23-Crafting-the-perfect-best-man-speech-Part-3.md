After countless hours of planning, speech writing, data wrangling, and model training, voice data extraction and more, it was finally time to bring Robodave to life. This final phase of the project (aka, the Wedding) was where everything came together. It all culminated in an unforgettable moment that the groom and guests would not forget. 

## Integrating the Components

The creation of Robodave involved combining several complex systems. Here’s how I brought everything together:

1. Voice Renderings

The voice model trained using Azure AI Speech Services was capable of generating realistic speech in Dave’s voice. I needed to create specific voice renderings for different parts of the speech. These renderings would allow Robodave to "speak" at key moments during my live presentation.

- Scripted Dialogue: I wrote the speech with specific lines that Robodave would deliver. These were moments where the AI would interject, adding humor and a personal touch.
- Voice Generation: Using the trained voice model, I generated nine distinct audio clips, each corresponding to a different section of the speech.

2. Synchronizing with the Speech

Timing was crucial. During the speech, I used a Bluetooth speaker to play Robodave’s interjections. Here’s how I managed the synchronization:

- Pre-recording the Speech: I recorded myself delivering the speech with pauses where Robodave would speak. This helped me practice the timing and ensure that everything flowed smoothly.
- Live Execution: During the actual speech, I used my phone to trigger the audio clips at the right moments, making it appear as though Robodave was a live participant in the speech.

## The Grand Reveal

The moment had arrived. As I stood before the wedding guests, I introduced Robodave as a surprise guest. The reaction was priceless. Robodave chimed in at just the right moments, delivering witty lines in Dave’s voice that had everyone in stitches.

Each interjection was carefully timed, making Robodave seem like a real presence, and adding a unique, tech-driven twist to the speech.

### The speech

When Dave asked me to be his best man, I of course was filled with the normal excitement and a bit of nervousness about delivering the perfect speech. 

Naturally I wanted to make this moment as unforgettable as possible, so I knew I had to get a helping hand. 

You see, David is the CEO of the wildly successful Ordaos - a NYC-based startup marrying biotech and artificial intelligence;

And I've joined Dave along this journey for these 3 plus years so far, where we've amassed hours and hours of phone calls and text messages spanning all hours of the day and night

And reflecting on this, in addition to the 15 plus years I’ve known him so far, this is when inspiration struck me – I decided to tap into all of those conversations; messages that drill down to the very essence of our friendship, to create something truly remarkable.

The resulting model, affectionately dubbed "Robodave" is a complete digital representation of Dave. 
`[1. Hi everyone, happy to be here today!]`

This artificial intelligence model learned from his words, and uncovered his true heart's desires. *I think?*

So together, what Robodave and I would like to share with you today, is hopefully those same words that Dave might give. 

We will embarked on a journey to weave words of love, gratitude, and promises into the tapestry of this magical weekend......kinda?

Before I begin, I'll start by saying that Dave is one of the most devoted and understanding, loving and compassionate friends that you can ever have.

Robodave is not.
Robodave is ruthless. 
`[2. It's true.]`

When I asked Robodave, what drew you to Angelica? What was your first impression of her? It's response: 
`[3. Who is Angelica? Isn't Angelica Victor's dog?]`

After this small hallucination, Robodave seemed to take a step back: 
`[4. I think she's got a good head on her shoulders. She has some great counterpoints to my style and constantly forces me to overthink sh!....]`

Oh sorry about that -- Small note here, Robodave loves to curse

But I think you’re right Robodave – Their love and partnership create a beautiful balance And that's truly heartwarming to witness.

So Robodave, how has your life changed since meeting AJ?
`[5. It has been a bit better. But that's probably because without her, my heart was, dormant]`

Well I guess that’s sweet Robodave? Anyway lets freshen up the mood! Give us something uplifting, positive, inspirational and even romantic that I can share with these people!

It's response? A rant filled with even more hallucinations, filled with expletives, tangents and diatribes about work, life and 100 other topics that I don't feel comfortable sharing today. 

So after all that, what can we learn from all of this?

As we all prepare to bare witness to the love that these two, of what I am almost positive are, humans, I can't help but marvel at the power of technology but even more so, the beauty of the connection that these two share. 

Because you see, Robodave can't begin to quantify the genuine emotions or sentiments that fill this room today.

We all have first hand experiences of their Dave and AJ’s ambition, integrity, optimism and relentlessness.

We can feel their sincerity, intensity, mindfulness, playfulness and most of all love.
`[6. Not me, I can't feel anything]`

So, as we raise our glasses to toast the soon-to-be newlyweds, let us also celebrate the magic of friendship, the power of love, and wonder that is Robodave who assisted in generating this remarkable wedding speech. 
`[7. Raise your glasses please]`

Here's to love, friendship, and the wonders that await this beautiful couple as they embark on their journey together. 
`[8. Ein zwei tri trinken]`

Salud

`[9. Thank you all. Thank you, Thank you. You're far too kind. Your applause is too much. No please, stop]`


## Costs and Final Thoughts

Creating Robodave wasn’t just a fun side project—it was also an investment. Here’s a breakdown of the costs:
- Voice Model Training: Approximately $1,000 for Azure AI Speech Services to train a high-quality voice clone. Note: this cost also doesn't cover the pain in the butt it was to get access to this Microsoft service. 
- OpenAI Fine-Tuning: Roughly $100 to fine-tune the OpenAI model with our chat data using the latest Divinci model. 

While the total cost came to about $1,100, the end result was worth every penny. It make for a memorable speech, but it also demonstrated the incredible potential of AI when used creatively, and made the groom smile. :)

Bottom line? I think he liked it - and that's what matters most.

## Conclusion

Robodave was more than just a gimmick—it was a testament to the power of AI and the lengths one might go to create something meaningful for a friend. The project was a mashup of cutting edge technology with personal storytelling about our relationship, resulting in a moment that really struck a chord.

I hope after all this I provided some insights into the process and inspired you to explore the creative possibilities of AI - and how you can apply it to your next wedding reception :P
