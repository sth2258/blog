When Dave asked me to be the best man at his wedding, I knew I needed to do something special. The speech needed to not only reflect our friendship and also tip my cap to Dave’s experience as the CEO of a biotech startup (with a focus on AI). This is how Robodave was born. The goal was an AI-powered version of Dave that would make a cameo in my speech, adding some much needed comic relief to these sometimes stuffy speeches.

## Why Create an AI for a Wedding?

Dave’s lives in the AI world on a daily basis. Ordaos develops AI-driven solutions to drug discovery, so it's clear AI is more than just a job for him. I wanted my speech to resonate with that passion, creating a moment that would be both meaningful and entertaining for guests as well as him. After all, what better way to celebrate someone who’s pushing the boundaries of AI than by using that same technology to celebrate him?

### The Tech Behind Robodave

Creating Robodave wasn’t just about making a cool gimmick for a speech—it was a serious technical project that required the integration of several advanced tools and platforms. Here’s an overview of the key technologies I used:
- Azure AI Speech Services: This powerful tool allowed me to clone Dave’s voice, making it possible for Robodave to "speak" just like him. I needed a model that could accurately reproduce his tone, inflection, and personality, and Azure’s technology was up to the task.
- OpenAI API Fine-Tuning: To ensure that Robodave could respond in a way that felt natural, I fine-tuned an OpenAI model using real chat logs between Dave and me. This allowed the AI to generate responses that matched Dave’s unique communication style.
- Python and PowerShell: This was the glue that held everything together. From data preprocessing to automating tasks, Python was essential in managing the flow of information between different components of the project.

## The Plan

The project was ambitious, but I had a clear roadmap:
- Voice Cloning: The first step was to create a voice model that sounded just like Dave. This involved gathering audio data, processing it, and using Azure AI to build the voice clone.
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Next, I needed to gather and clean up a large dataset of our chat conversations to fine-tune the OpenAI model. This would ensure that Robodave could speak and respond in a way that felt authentic.
- Model Integration: Finally, I would bring everything together—integrating the voice model with the fine-tuned AI to create Robodave, who would "join" me in delivering the best man speech.

## Challenges and Expectations

I was in over my head from the beginning. Training AI models (never done that), especially for voice synthesis (never done that) and natural language processing (also never done that), is a complex task that requires a lot of data and experiences, which of course, I didn't have. All I could say is that I was confident that I was playing the right tools and that the output would be cool as hell. 

In Part 2, I cover the specifics of what data preprocessing work needed to be done, and how I made the start of things that made Robodave possible.
